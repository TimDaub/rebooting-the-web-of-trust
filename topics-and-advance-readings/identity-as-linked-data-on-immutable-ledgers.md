## Motivation

Content creators on the Web are getting a raw deal. They get a fraction of a cent for an ad played on YouTube, nothing
on Facebook, nothing in most places, yet consumers get more utility when watching. It’s hard to make a living when you’re
a creative. Licensing is hard. The UX is terrible, so lawyers and middlemen extract the most value. In the music
industry, more money flows in the hands of distributors rather than creatives. Consumers are often happy to pay for their
content. Instead though, they're forced to sit through ads or miss out on income due to ad-blockers.


## The COALA IP Working Group

To address these problems a group called COALA IP (Coalition Of Automated Legal Applications, Intellectual Property)
formed to design and implement a free and open specification for handling digital licensing of intellectual property. It's
goals are to establish open, free and easy ways to claim attribution, add meta data, license works, mediate IP disputes
and authenticate claims of others, all in a way where there is a global agreement at the data level, without centralized
control.

A recent, more concrete, endeavor of the group has been to write a specification for a protocol handling digital licensing of
intellectual property on immutable ledgers. It's an effort to transform the implementation-agnostic [Rights Reference Model](http://doi.org/10.1000/284)
of the [Linked Content Coalition](http://www.linkedcontentcoalition.org/index.php) into a free and open guideline,
outlining technologies that could be leveraged for implementation as well as structuration on how canonicalize an easily
approachable specification for all involved parties (creators, rights holders, consumers, developers, ...). The protocol is
ought to be technology-opinionated, while being ledger-agnostic.


## The COALA IP Protocol

The COALA IP protocol is essentially two concurrent technical efforts:

1. It's a community-driven effort to find and define a minimal-viable set of data for licensing intellectual property
   (using RDF schema definitions)
2. It's a free and open messaging/communication protocol for license-transactions


At its core, the RDF schema defines six main entities that form an ontology by connecting to other respective entities. The
ontology as well as all entities have been derived from the LCC's RRM:

- **Place:** A localizable, physical place (e.g. an address, a city, a country, ...)
- **(digital/physical) Manifestation:** A perceivable creation (e.g. a print of a photograph of a certain scene)
- **Creation:** A distinct, abstract creation whose existence is revealed through one or more manifestations (e.g. The idea
  to photograph a certain scene)
- **Right:** A transferable entity connected to a manifestation that entitles the owner to do something in relation
  to a Creation (e.g. a permission to display a Manifestation publicly)
- **RightsAssignment:** A transfer of a Right (e.g. Transferring the permission to display a Manifestation publicly)
- **Assertion:** A claim made about the truth or falsehood of assertions made in the ontology (e.g. A statement vouching
  for the validity that a certain Party is the original author of a Creation); and last but not least
- **Party:** An individual or a group of individuals representing right holders, licensors, users and so on...(e.g. a human being
  or a group of human beings)


Since finding a minimal viable set of properties that describe each of the entities' features is difficult without having
domain-specific industry knowledge, COALA IP's plan is to open this process up to the community, by letting it define
and derive domain-specific RDF schemata. As soon as saturation for changes in schemata emerge, further formalization is planned
to take the them to an international standards organization appropriate.

Key technologies used to achieve this endeavor are:


- **[JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/):** A recently emerged RDF serialization format, that brings Linked Data to the
  JSON data structure
- **[IPLD](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/tree/master/ipld):** A data structure to merkle-link JSON objects in order to
  retrieve them with merkle-paths, providing cryptographic integrity-checking of the data as well as content-addressable
  storage
- **[ILP](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs):** A set of specifications for sending (at this point only: fungible) digital
  assets across different ledgers


## The Missing Link: Identity

At the point of writing this position paper (almost) all pieces of the specification are in place, except for a crucial one:
Identity (the so called "Party" entity mentioned in the previous section).

Members of the COALA IP working group would like to actively participate in design-workshops of the Web of Trust working
group to discuss identity solutions that fulfill the following systematic requirements:

- An Identity's identifier must be resolvable within the Internet
- An Identity's properties must enable other Identities to validate the cryptographic integrity of an Identity's signed data
- An Identity must have at least one persistent unique public identifier that is both human- and machine-readable
- An Identity's identifier should have multiple designations (e.g. compare to [IBAN designations](http://www.isbn.org/about_isbn_standard))
- An Identity participates in a global trust network, having it's trustworthiness continuously evaluated by other
  participating Identities


In order to be compliant with the current state of the COALA IP protocol, the following requirements should be fulfilled:

- Is an Identity resolved within the Internet, then it's data can be integrity-checked cryptographically (compare: content-addressed
  storage provided by IPFS and IPLD is favored)
- Preferred serialization formats of an Identity object are JSON, JSON-LD or IPLD
- A resulting specification regarding Identity management respects the immutability of data


Additionally, some philosophical requirements the COALA IP group would like to address:

- A digital Identity solution must not be based on any proprietary technology
